# Peer Support report

* This report uses dummy data in a Microsoft Excel workbook to present key insights about Acme's (fictional organisiation) Peer Support programme.
* The goal is to **make it as obvious as possible to the reader what the Peer Support data is telling us without the need to click on visuals and slicers.**
* The use of **measures and card visuals** is a great way to highlight key statistics (e.g. most frequently occurring category)
* Due to limited time available the look and feel (e.g. colour scheme) there is room for improvement in this report (see below).

# Instructions

* Download the Excel workbook to your preferred folder location on your computer
* Download the Power BI Desktop (pbix) file.
* Update the Power Query in the pbix file so that it reads in the Excel workbook from your chosen folder location

# Areas for further development

* Improve the general **look and feel** (e.g. integrating colour scheme of visuals with the colour scheme of the canvas)
* Use **icons** (e.g. green upward arrow, red downward arrow) to clearly show any temporal changes in data (e.g. increases/decreases since last month)
* Include **additional metrics** (e.g. Peer Support interventions for departmental employee) to **address issues of scale** (e.g. larger departments are more likely to have greater numbers of Peer Support interventions)
